This presentation was one of the best I've heard on the process of creating socially valuable outcomes from open data. 
Very quickly off the top of my head, these are the things I'd abstract from what Trafford Intelligence Lab are doing that are making it work:

1. People
more detail to follow 

2. embedded but in a semi detached, in-between space
more detail to follow 

3. granular
more detail to follow 

4. time frames
more detail to follow 

5. local-ness
