WHAT IS OPEN DATA?

WHAT IS SOCIAL VALUE?
as a good enough definition for the time being, maybe we could define socially valuable by what it's not. 
Banking, for instance, is socially useless: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/6096546/City-is-too-big-and-socially-useless-says-Lord-Turner.html

THE ARTS AS SOCIAL VALUE
too big a question for me

CONFERENCE SESSION NOTES

* Keynote session
http://summit.theodi.org/events/introduction-to-generation-open/
http://summit.theodi.org/events/keynote-speech/

The most interesting talk in the keynote session was from Hetan Shah, the chief executive of the 188 year old Royal Statistical Society. Interestingly for such an august body, his was one of the parts of the keynote session with a political edge: he raised the question of open data in the private sector, given that so many public services are now privatised. The other political part was Neelie Kroes championing the role of the state in fostering innovation.

* Improving society & government efficiency session

presentsation - Using open data to level up common knowledge of the local area
Jamie White, Trafford Intelligence Lab 
http://www.infotrafford.org.uk/lab/blog/all-about-the-lab

This presentation was one of the best I've heard on the process of creating socially valuable outcomes from open data. 
Very quickly off the top of my head, these are the things I'd abstract from what Trafford Intelligence Lab are doing:

1. People
there was a genuine and infectious enthusiasm for making meaningful things happen, and this energy must at least have helped to build some momentum in the early stages. Jamie White seemed satisfied that his group (of only 3 people) had the right range of skills at least to make a start, two data analysts and a javascript and html developer (if I remember rightly).

2.  outcomes socially defined in Trafford
within that limitation of targets framed by Whitehall, Westminster and The City, the choice of projects and emphasis seemed to reflect priorities and interests of people in Trafford. 

3. embedded but in a semi detached, in-between space
The group started out working in a room in a library, then in a housing association, so they were within the council formally, but with some distance, and that might provide licence to experiment?

4. granular
Local knowledge, experience and contacts meant they were able to care enough about, understand and take insights from the data at a very granular level, and this then led to interventions that could be made right down at the level of a single street. 

5. short feedback loops
for example generating buy-in and support from local politicians because they could knock up a visualisation of where people came from to do the Trafford marathon, which helped politicians explain spending choices. 

6. time frames
A year so far. 10 years should be the minimum time frame. 

7. local-ness
Interesting that the value having local definitions of what challenges get priority was supported in the Citizen Empowerment session, with experience from Africa: "local solutions are often more successful" Loren Treisman, Indigo Trust.


* Data in Culture session
http://summit.theodi.org/events/data-as-culture-panel/
The boss of Somerset House they are mounting a data exhibition because data is "a revolution in our culture". 
This is what wikipedia says a revolution is (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution):
"A revolution (from the Latin revolutio, "a turn around") is a fundamental change in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time. Aristotle described two types of political revolution:
Complete change from one constitution to another
Modification of an existing constitution.[1]"

"Thinking a bit less about growth and more about reflection" an artist from the same session.
